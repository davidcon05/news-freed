#Project Roadmap: Reliable News & Offline Reader

##Phase 1: The UI Shell & Static Feed
Goal: Get the visual structure in place using Compose and mock data.

Project Setup: Initialize a New Android Project (Empty Compose Activity). Install dependencies: Hilt (DI), Retrofit, Room, and Navigation.

Scaffold & Navigation: Implement a Scaffold with a BottomNavigation (Discovery Tab and Bookmarks Tab).

Discovery UI: Build a LazyColumn that accepts a list of Article objects.

The Bottom Sheet: Use ModalBottomSheetLayout. Create a DetailContent composable that displays the article's image, description, and a "Source" button.

State Logic: Wire it so tapping a list item updates a selectedArticle state, which then expands the Bottom Sheet.

##Phase 2: Networking (The "Everything can fail" Layer)
Goal: Connect to NewsAPI and handle the reality of the web.

API Integration: Create your NewsService interface. Start with a single endpoint: GET /v2/top-headlines?country=us.

The Repository Pattern: Create a NewsRepository. The ViewModel should ask the Repository for data, not the API directly.

Coroutines & Flow: Use a StateFlow in your ViewModel to represent Loading, Success(data), and Error.

The Interceptor (Tester Skill): Add an OkHttp Interceptor that logs every request.

Challenge: Hardcode it to randomly return a 500 Internal Server Error 10% of the time to see how your UI handles it.

---

##Phase 3: Persistence (The "Offline First" Layer)
Goal: Use Room to make the app work without an internet connection.

Room Setup: Define an ArticleEntity and a NewsDatabase.

The "Bookmark" Action: Inside the Bottom Sheet, add a Bookmark icon. When clicked, it triggers a Room Insert.

Local Flow: Update the Bookmarks Tab to observe a Flow<List<ArticleEntity>> from the database.

Manual Offline Check: Implement a "Save for Offline" toggle. If toggled, the app should download the full article body to the DB.

---

##Phase 4: Framework Deep Dive (WorkManager & Notifications)
Goal: Integrate with the Android OS lifecycle.

Background Sync: Create a SyncWorker using WorkManager.

Constraint: Configure it to only run when the device is on Wi-Fi.

System Notifications: When the Worker finds a new "Breaking News" story, trigger a system notification.

Deep Linking: Use a PendingIntent so that clicking the notification opens the app directly to that article's Bottom Sheet.

---

##Phase 5: The Test Engineer’s "Hardening"
Goal: Apply your specific background to make the code un-flaky.

Unit Testing Flows: Write tests for your ViewModel using Turbine (a library for testing Flows) to ensure Loading always happens before Success.

Dependency Injection: Use Hilt to swap your real NewsService with a FakeNewsService for your UI tests.

Idling Resources: (Since you know Espresso) Ensure your Compose tests don't need Thread.sleep() by properly using collectAsStateWithLifecycle.
